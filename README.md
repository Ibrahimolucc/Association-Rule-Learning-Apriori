Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering interesting relations between variables in datasets. The most of electronic marketplace are used this methods for be able to offer some items to their customers.

I made this project on Kaggle platform. ( https://www.kaggle.com/code/ibrahimoluc/association-rule-learning-apriori ) 
 
DATASET = " online_retail_II.xlsx " . You can find on Kaggle platform.

In this case, we will focus on Online Retail II datasets. This dataset include:

    StockCode: Product code
    Description: Product Name
    Quantity: Product counts

    Price: A single product price
    CustomerID: Unique customer number
